I feel very happy for them..

He is looking for his work after every 10 to 15 mintues going out and coming in. Once I did with my interview. After few weeks I followed up with them about the status of my interview sessions. Unfortunately, the people even don't bother to reply. Especially its HR responsibility along with the general manager who takes my interview to at least revert to candidates who make themself available to interviewing them and investing their time.\n\nI really appreciate your approach."""

When I used to be recruiter, I used to do the same mistake ""We will get back to you"", but very quicklly realised how it had impacted my performance, from then I used to give feedback for sure, which will help both. If some one is not able to give feedback, he lacks the skill to interview. Used to fight with panels for feedback.\n\nInterviewers should be trained how to take interviews! And HR should insist this, most HR doesnt care this, since they are running behind targets and losing the value of the profession.
